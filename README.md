# üêç PythonBeginner

This folder contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects designed to build foundational programming skills. The projects vary in type‚Äîsome are console-based, while others use graphical interfaces like `turtle` and `tkinter`.

## üîç What‚Äôs Inside

The projects in this folder explore a wide range of Python features, including:

- **Variables and data types**  
- **Conditional statements and loops**  
- **Functions and exception handling**  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, method overriding  
- **Basic file and module structure**: Importing from custom modules  
- **Standard library modules** like `time`, `random`, and `turtle`  
- **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)** using `tkinter`  
- **Event-driven programming and keybinding**  
- **Simple game logic and animations**

## üß† Skills Practiced

These projects are ideal for:
- Strengthening problem-solving using Python
- Getting hands-on with OOP concepts through visual and interactive coding
- Writing clean, modular code
- Understanding how logic flows through user input, game loops, or UI events

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

Run any script like so:
```bash
python filename.py
````

For example:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

Some programs may open a graphical window depending on the libraries used.
